# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ## In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# # ***Objectives.***
# - understand data science
# - work using different data science tools
# * recognize various data science ecosistems 
# * name different libraries
# + beginnig deep jupyter notebook practice 
# 

# ### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. Java
# 3. R
# 4. C&C++
# 5. SQL
# 6. Julia

# # Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# Scientifics computing Libraries
# 1. Pandas
# 2. NumPy
# 
# Visualization Libraries
# 1. Matplotlib
# 2. Seaborn
# 
# Machine learning and deep learning Libraries
# 1. Scikit-learn 
# 2. Keras
#

# | Apache Hadoop | 

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[5]:


x = 2.3
Y = x * 6

print (x)


# In[12]:


#### This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply three times four then add five
(3*4)+5


# In[8]:


x = (3*25)
y = x*(2.8 *14.2)

print (y)


# In[13]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
x = 200
y = 60

z = (x / y)

print (z)
